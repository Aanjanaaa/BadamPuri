            <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
            <ol class="preparation-steps">
                <li>Microwave milk and saffron for 30 seconds. Allow to cool.</li>
                <li>Combine almond flour, sugar, milk powder, and cardamom powder in a bowl. Incorporate the
                    saffron-infused
                    milk to form a firm dough. Divide into three portions.
                </li>
                <li>Take this dough between parchment paper sheets and gently roll the dough with a
                    rolling-pin.
                    Roll out a portion of the dough to medium thickness. Use a grease cookie cutter for uniform puris
                    and place
                    on a tray.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat your oven and broil the puris for 4-5 minutes until a slight color change.
                    Remove, cool slightly, then flip and broil again for 4-5 minutes until done.
                </li>
                <li>Allow the Badam Puris to cool. Serve and enjoy every bite.</li>
